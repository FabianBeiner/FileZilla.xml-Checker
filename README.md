# FileZilla.xml-Checker
v1.0

**This script tests all available servers found in your FileZilla.xml file. So you can easily determinate, which of the sites are online and which are offline.**

This script is made possible through FileZillaâ€™s crappy security definitions. I mean, seriously, saving passwords in plaintext? Sucks.

Here is my advice: Since FileZilla is an awesome, free client, use it. However, keep it in a crypto-container, created with (e.g.) TrueCrypt.
